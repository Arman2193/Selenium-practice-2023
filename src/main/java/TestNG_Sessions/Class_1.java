		//Notes:
		// Testng is only used in Java- unit test framework
		//1.We can systematically write the test cases ,
		//2.set priority -which test case should execute first
		//3.generate html reports
		//4.Dependency - where one test case is dependent on other test case
		//5. we can use listeners concept
		//6.parallel test cases execution on multiple browsers
		//7.Assertions- validations logic 
		//8.Retry logic-we can run test cases multiple times
		//9.defining pre/post conditions
		//10. data driven-- data providers- to execute with different set of data
		//11. Writing positive negative test cases
		
		// We have test ng -jar files
		// 1.Add a dependency in--pom.xml - so that we ca use the methods and classes
		// 2.install a testng plugin on eclipse- so that we can run the tests with test ng
		
		// Please note all the testng -test cases needs to maintained under src/test/java folder
